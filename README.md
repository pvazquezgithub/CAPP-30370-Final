CAPP-30370-Final
================

Final Project

The purpose of this site was to have a website on tennis.  I have a home page and a separate page for each of the tennis majors.

I used two breakpoint at 700px and 1000px.  For the mobile view I have everything in one column stacked ontop of each other.  For the tablet version I have the links going across in a row and then all of the other information in a column below it.  For the desktop view I have the links on the left side of the page in a column.  I then have the main content in the middle column, and a schedule for the majors on the right column.  For the continuous css loop, I have a tennis ball bouncing on the left side of the page.  For the css animation that runs on the user interaction, I have the image links increase in size when the mouse hovers over the images.  For the background image I have a blue background on the home page.  Finally for the visual jquery interaction I have an image on the home page that when clicked it increases in size.
